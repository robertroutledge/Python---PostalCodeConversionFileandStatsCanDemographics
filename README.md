# StatsCanDemo

main.py reads manual downlaods from stats can website, voters list and postal code conversion file to create the ability to get demographic data at the dissemination area level of stats can - and assign it to a poll (BC Provincial Boundaries 2022)

Commented-out sections can be uncommented as each function can create a new static file, reducing runtime for future runs of the program.
